# Tools

## Career Compass (`career-compass/index.html`)

A single-page tool that shows what you need for different jobs in
Finland, Sweden, Norway, France and Japan, and compares each requirement
with the certificates two people (Aya and Max) already have.

- **Start screen:** pick Aya or Max; the whole tool then shows only that person's
  toolbox, jobs and numbers ("Show all jobs" shows the other person's jobs too).
- **Toolbox:** tap certificates and languages to mark them as have / in progress.
- **Find my best option:** buttons for freedom, money, stability, lower investment,
  quickest start and balanced; shows the top 3 different jobs with their best country.
- **Who fits best:** the top job + country matches for each person.
- **Overview table:** readiness, cost left, break-even time, yearly pay or 5-year value
  (take-home pay over 5 years minus training fees) for each job in each country.
- **Money:** rough course fees still to pay, time to get ready, typical pay, and when the
  training (or a business investment) pays for itself. A slider sets how much of your
  take-home pay goes to paying it back.
- **Job cards:** checklist, whether the job is regulated by law, time needed,
  right-to-work notes and official links.
